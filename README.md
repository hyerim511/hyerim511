<h3 align="center">My name is Hyerim, and I'm a Web Developer and Designer :woman_astronaut:</h3>

<p>
Hello, I'm a web developer with over 10 years of experience in UI/UX and graphic design. Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

In addition to my core skills, I have actively expanded my knowledge by learning SCSS, VueJS, PHP, Wordpress, Bootstrap, Git (including Github), and MySQL. I acquired these skills not only through personal projects but also through engaging team projects. Currently, I am also in the process of learning ReactJS, and I have a growing interest in ThreeJS with Blender.

I am actively seeking a Front-end web developer position where I can apply my experience and diverse skills. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise to a dynamic and forward-thinking team.

Thank you for reading, and I hope to see you soon :)
</p>
