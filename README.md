<h3 align="center">My name is Hyerim, and I'm a Web Developer and Designer :woman_astronaut:</h3>

<p>
I'm a web developer with over 10 years of experience in UI/UX and graphic design. Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

In addition to my core skills, I have actively expanded my knowledge by learning SCSS, VueJS, PHP, Wordpress, Bootstrap, Git (including Github), and MySQL. I acquired these skills not only through personal projects but also through engaging team projects. Currently, I am also in the process of learning ReactJS, and I have a growing interest in TypeScript and Python :laughing:
